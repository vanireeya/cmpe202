### Lab assignment - 10


In Lab1, we were required to support different models for gumball machines which accepts different coins. For this, I made three different objects of the gumball machine which defined what type of model the gumball machine supports. Any changes in the requirement or cost of gumball would result in heavy change in my code. 

While in lab2, using AspectJ and FeatureIDE, configurations are managed in config file. Here the type of model can be selected before running the code. This results in simpler code and manageable configuration. It also supports the ability to adapt to new requirements which minimum change in code. 

### Screenshots of the code:
